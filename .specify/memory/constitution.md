# Next Generation TODOs

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- All production code MUST satisfy repository linting, formatting, and static analysis gates before review.
- Every change MUST undergo peer review that validates readability, maintainability, and adherence to documented patterns.
- Shared logic MUST be implemented once and reused; any deliberate duplication REQUIRES a written justification in the change description.
- Public interfaces MUST include up-to-date documentation and usage examples alongside the implementation.
**Rationale**: Disciplined quality practices prevent regressions, reduce maintenance cost, and allow contributors to extend the system confidently.

### II. Test Discipline & Coverage
- Tests for new behavior MUST be defined before implementation and committed within the same change set.
- Each feature MUST include unit, integration, or contract coverage that exercises the primary user journeys and failure modes.
- Automated test suites MUST run in continuous integration; any failing test blocks merge until corrected or explicitly exempted by governance.
- Teams MUST track coverage trends and add regression tests for every user-facing bug before closing the issue.
**Rationale**: Comprehensive, automated testing provides the safety net required for iterative delivery and guards against silent breakage.

### III. Consistent User Experience
- Interfaces MUST align with the approved design system, interaction patterns, and copy guidelines for the platform.
- Designs MUST demonstrate WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance; any exception REQUIRES a documented remediation plan.
- Critical user flows MUST include acceptance criteria that cover usability, localization, and error-handling states.
- UX changes MUST be reviewed with product/design representatives before implementation begins.
**Rationale**: A consistent, accessible experience builds user trust and lowers support costs across releases.

### IV. Performance Stewardship
- Each feature MUST declare target latency, throughput, and resource usage budgets before coding starts.
- Implementations MUST include instrumentation or profiling hooks that verify the declared budgets in staging or automated pipelines.
- Performance regressions beyond agreed budgets block release until resolved or waived with governance approval.
- Long-running tasks MUST provide progress feedback or asynchronous execution paths to protect responsiveness.
**Rationale**: Proactive performance management preserves responsiveness at scale and prevents costly retrofits.

## Engineering Standards

- Source control workflows MUST keep the `main` branch releasable; feature work proceeds on short-lived branches merged via reviewed pull requests.
- Dependency additions MUST include risk assessment covering security posture, maintenance cadence, and integration cost.
- Documentation for architecture decisions, data models, and operational runbooks MUST be updated before shipping a feature.
- Environments MUST maintain parity (development, staging, production) to ensure tests reliably predict production behavior.

## Delivery Workflow & Quality Gates

- Every feature plan MUST pass a Constitution Check confirming alignment with all Core Principles prior to development.
- Implementation work MUST follow a test-first workflow: author tests → observe failure → implement → refactor with green tests.
- Releases MUST include UX validation, accessibility verification, and performance sign-off from accountable owners.
- Post-release reviews MUST collect telemetry, user feedback, and defect trends to feed back into future planning.

## Governance

- **Amendments**: Proposals require written rationale, impact analysis, and sign-off from engineering, design, and product leads. Approval demands unanimous consent from these leads.
- **Versioning**: Increment MAJOR for principle additions/removals or governance overhauls, MINOR for new guidance within existing principles, PATCH for clarifications without behavioral change.
- **Compliance**: Quarterly audits sample active projects for adherence to principles; findings result in remediation plans tracked to completion.
- **Waivers**: Temporary exemptions MUST document scope, duration, mitigation steps, and owner; waivers expire automatically after their stated term.
