# Feature Specification: TODO List Application

**Feature Branch**: `[001-todo-list]`  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "构建一个 TODO List 的应用"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Capture daily tasks (Priority: P1)

Signed-in users capture, view, edit, and complete personal tasks to manage their daily commitments from any device.

**Why this priority**: Reliable task capture is the core value of a TODO application; without it the product fails to deliver utility.

**Independent Test**: Create sample tasks, update details, toggle completion, refresh the page, and confirm the list persists with correct states.

**UX Consistency**: Use primary input field, buttons, and list components from the SDD Practice design system; provide accessible labels, focus order, and status messages meeting WCAG 2.1 AA.

**Performance Budget**: Task creation and completion toggles respond within 100 ms p95; initial task list render completes under 2 s on a simulated 3G connection with 500 tasks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a signed-in user on the task list, **When** they enter a valid title and press submit, **Then** the task appears at the top of the list with default status "Active" and persists after refresh.
2. **Given** an existing active task, **When** the user marks it complete, **Then** the task shows as completed, moves to the completed section, and can be restored if undone within 30 seconds.

### User Story 2 - Organize tasks by context (Priority: P2)

Users group tasks by due date and custom categories, then filter views to focus on specific commitments (e.g., "Today", "Work").

**Why this priority**: Organization improves task recall and reduces overload, directly influencing completion rates.

**Independent Test**: Create categories, assign tasks, apply filters for date and category, and confirm only matching tasks display while counts remain accurate.

**UX Consistency**: Reuse tab, filter chip, and badge components with accessible states and descriptive helper text; ensure color usage meets contrast standards.

**Performance Budget**: Applying any filter returns results within 150 ms p95 for up to 1,000 tasks; switching between views maintains 60 fps scroll performance on mid-tier devices.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** tasks categorized as "Work" and "Personal", **When** the user selects the "Work" filter, **Then** only work tasks display and summary counts update to match.
2. **Given** tasks with due dates, **When** the user selects the "Today" quick filter, **Then** tasks due today show with a highlighted badge and others remain hidden until the filter is cleared.

### User Story 3 - Stay on track with reminders (Priority: P3)

Users set reminders on critical tasks and receive timely notifications so nothing slips through the cracks.

**Why this priority**: Reminders reinforce habit formation and differentiate the app from a static checklist.

**Independent Test**: Schedule reminders for tasks due within the next hour, trigger the reminder window in test mode, and verify notifications appear across supported channels with actionable links.

**UX Consistency**: Apply modal and form components for reminder setup, reuse toast/notification patterns, and provide accessible time pickers with screen reader support.

**Performance Budget**: Reminder scheduling executes within 200 ms p95; notifications fire within ±60 seconds of the configured time and do not block UI responsiveness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a task with a due time, **When** the user schedules a reminder 30 minutes before due, **Then** the reminder is saved, visible on the task card, and editable.
2. **Given** the reminder time arrives, **When** the user is active in the app, **Then** an in-app notification surfaces with task context and an action to mark complete.

### Edge Cases

- Prevent saving a task without a non-empty title and surface inline error messaging.
- Handle due dates set in the past by prompting the user to adjust or confirm the schedule.
- Preserve performance and scrollability when the task list exceeds 1,000 items.
- Maintain data integrity when connectivity is interrupted during task edits by queuing and retrying updates.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow authenticated users to create, edit, complete, and delete personal tasks with mandatory title and optional description.
- **FR-002**: System MUST persist task state changes in real time so completion status, edits, and deletions survive session refresh across devices.
- **FR-003**: System MUST support due dates, reminder lead times, and category assignments per task, validating against past scheduling unless explicitly confirmed by the user.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide filters for due status (Today, Upcoming, Overdue) and categories, reflecting selections in both task list and summary counts.
- **FR-005**: System MUST deliver reminder notifications through in-app messaging and send follow-up alerts when users are inactive until the task is completed or dismissed.

### Quality & Non-Functional Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **QNR-001**: Implementation MUST satisfy repository linting, formatting, and static analysis requirements with zero outstanding warnings.
- **QNR-002**: Automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests MUST cover task CRUD flows, filtering logic, and reminder scheduling, running in CI for every change.
- **QNR-003**: Experience MUST reuse approved design system components, provide accessible labels, and meet WCAG 2.1 AA for all interactive elements and states.
- **QNR-004**: Feature MUST maintain task list render p95 < 2 s for 500 tasks and reminder scheduling/notification latency within defined budgets, validated via instrumentation.
- **QNR-005**: Observability MUST capture metrics for task creation and completion rates, filter usage, reminder delivery success, and log anomalies for debugging.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Task**: Represents a user-authored commitment with attributes title, description, due date/time, completion status, category assignments, reminder settings, and timestamps.
- **Category**: User-defined label with name, optional color/icon, and ordering used to group tasks; many-to-many relationship with tasks.
- **Reminder**: Scheduling metadata linked to a task, storing reminder time, delivery channels, delivery state, and last notification timestamp.

## Assumptions

- Application ships as a responsive web experience leveraging the existing SDD Practice authentication system for user identity.
- Organization provides a notification service capable of delivering in-app and email alerts that this feature can consume.
- Users manage only their own private tasks; collaborative task sharing is out of scope for this release.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of new users create and complete their first task within 60 seconds of landing on the app.
- **SC-002**: Task list view maintains p95 load time under 2 seconds with 500 tasks on mid-tier devices and networks.
- **SC-003**: 90% of scheduled reminders are delivered within ±1 minute of their configured time across supported channels.
- **SC-004**: Beta satisfaction score for task management flows reaches ≥4.5/5, and fewer than 5% of sessions trigger task-related support requests.
